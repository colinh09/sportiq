**Module 1: Understanding the Basics of Baseball**

The first subject to grasp when learning about MLB is the structure of the game itself. Baseball is played between two teams, each consisting of nine players. The main objective is to score runs by hitting a ball and running around four bases arranged in a diamond shape.

Key components include:

- **Innings**: The game is divided into innings, with each team getting a turn to bat and a turn to field.
- **Positions**: Familiarize yourself with player positions, such as pitcher, catcher, and outfielders.
- **Scoring**: A run is scored when a player successfully reaches home plate after touching all four bases.

Understanding these basics lays the foundation for deeper knowledge of the game.

**Module 2: Key Rules and Gameplay Mechanics of MLB**

In this module, we will explore the essential rules and gameplay mechanics that govern MLB.

Key Points:
- **Innings and Outs**: A standard game consists of nine innings. Each team has three outs per inning.
- **Batting Orders**: Teams must follow a specific order when batting, which is set before the game.
- **Strikes and Balls**: A batter faces pitches that can be classified as strikes (good pitches) or balls (bad pitches). A count of three strikes results in an out, while four balls allow the batter to walk to first base.
- **Foul Balls**: A ball hit outside the fair territory is considered a foul. A foul ball counts as a strike unless the batter already has two strikes.

Understanding these rules is crucial for following the game and appreciating its strategies.




**Module 3: Player Roles and Responsibilities in MLB**

In this module, we'll focus on the various player roles and their responsibilities within a Major League Baseball team.

Key Points:
- **Pitcher**: The player who throws the ball to the batter, aiming to get them out.
- **Catcher**: Positioned behind home plate, they receive pitches and guide the pitcher.
- **Infielders**: Players positioned around the bases (first, second, shortstop, third) who field balls hit near them.
- **Outfielders**: Positioned in the outfield, they catch balls that are hit far from the infield.

Understanding these roles helps in grasping how teams strategize during games and collaborate to achieve success.
